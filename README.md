# UCL-CS Setup Your Environment

Welcome to Set Up Your Environment, a UCL Computer Science initiative to help you get your laptop ready with everything 
you need to do your first-year work. This documentation is divided up by Windows 10, macOS and Linux, so head on to your 
favourite platform on the left and letâ€™s get you ready to code!

Note that the toolset included in this article is designed to appeal to beginners and experienced developers alike and 
is based on personal experience. Feel free to tweak what is recommend based on your personal preferences. By the end 
of it you should be able to program and run code written in:
* C
* Haskell
* Java
* Python

We recommend you start with the [free stuff](/all/free-stuff.md) section before going onto your platform.
